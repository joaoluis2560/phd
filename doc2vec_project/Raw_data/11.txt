Abstract
Objective: Evaluate the clinical use of the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale as predictive of early weaning and
verify if women who had higher self-efficacy scores breastfed for longer periods.
Methods: Cohort study developed with 100 postpartum mothers. Research instrument used: Breastfeeding
Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form. The feeding was monitored on the 7th, 15th, 30th, 45th and 60th day, by
phone.
Results: The mean duration of exclusive breastfeeding was 53.2 days (SD 14.2). Most mothers (82.3%) had
scores compatible with high self-efficacy for breastfeeding, none had low efficacy. There was no statistically
significant difference in the comparison of mean duration of exclusive and non-exclusive breastfeeding, with
the scores of medium and high efficacy.
Conclusion: Findings did not enable the confirmation of the use of the scale as a predictor of risk of early
weaning. No relation was observed between higher scores of high efficacy and longer periods of exclusive
breastfeeding.

Breastfeeding self-efficacy: a cohort study

Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the
United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) have
undertaken efforts to protect, promote and support exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), so that mothers are able to establish and keep it for the first
six months of life of the baby.(1) But this reality
in Brazil is still far from being achieved, since the
prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6
months is only 41%, according to the latest survey
conducted in the Brazilian capitals and the Federal
District (DF).(2)
Breastfeeding (BF) is considered, worldwide,
one of the fundamental pillars for promoting and
protecting the health of children and its social impact can be quantified through the reduction of
medical consultations, hospitalizations and medical
treatments, since the child in EBF has lower risk
of becoming ill.(3) The obstacles to breastfeeding are
numerous, but generally the allegations to its abandonment involve myths and misinformation, even
among women with higher socioeconomic status,
which confirms the importance of guidance and
interventions from healthcare professionals in supporting nursing mothers.
The advancement of public health policies
in encouraging BF is increasingly evident.(4) The
outlining of these actions is notorious and covers
a great part of the women using the public health
network. On the other hand, women who do not
use this network and are assisted in private institutions not always can count on professional support
to help them during the difficulties in BF, especially
after discharge.
In this context, it becomes necessary to reformulate strategies, mainly from the private health
network, to promote, protect and support EBF,
reinforcing the adherence of women who are able
to be assisted in the private health network. These
mothers generally receive breastfeeding support
while hospitalized, however, almost no institution
has resources available to maintain this support after delivery in the domicile, or has breastfeeding
outpatient services. These deficiencies may favor
early weaning in this segment.

Acta Paul Enferm. 2014; 27(5):465-70

Therefore, the institutions and professionals in
the private health network are faced with the challenge of implementing breastfeeding care practices
during the prenatal, delivery and postpartum periods, mainly because of the need for professional
support mothers have in the first days after birth,
a phase that is a defining moment to overcome a
series of obstacles to breastfeeding and to avoid its
abandonment.
Following up mother and baby at a breastfeeding outpatient service, until the tenth day after
discharge, represents a strategy that can contribute to reverse an inadequate indication of formula
supplementation, or even a possible breastfeeding
interruption.(5) Unfortunately, there are only a few
private health services that promote monitoring of
both mother and child after discharge.
Learning the willingness of mothers to breastfeeding can be a way to predict whether they will
maintain the recommended breastfeeding period,
which would help professionals to identify difficulties and weaknesses and establish supportive
interventions. The application of a breastfeeding
self-efficacy scale could point out the mothers with
more weaknesses, in the aspects required in the
process of breastfeeding, and allow interventions
during provision of nursing care that occurs after
childbirth, intending to provide support for successful breastfeeding.
A study associated longer periods of EBF with
the determination of the mothers to breastfeed, and
it recommended attention from health professionals
to the absence of mothers’ determination to breastfeeding, so that interventions can be performed to
consolidate this practice.(6)
The objective of this study was to evaluate the
clinical use of the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale
as predictive of early weaning and to verify if the
women who had higher self-efficacy scores breastfed
longer than those who had lower scores.

Methods
This is a cohort study conducted in a large private
hospital, located in an upscale neighborhood of the

Souza EF, Fernandes RA

city of São Paulo. The sample was defined by convenience and comprised 100 postpartum women who
gave birth in the period between November 2010
and April 2011, and who met the following inclusion criteria: being in postpartum (48-72 hours
after delivery); having agreed to participate in the
study for up to 60 days after the baby’s birth; having
a landline or mobile phone number; being breastfeeding exclusively during hospitalization.
The survey instrument used was the Escala de
Autoeficácia na Amamentação, the Brazilian version
of the Breastfeeding Self-Eficacy Scale-Short Form
(BSES-SF). This scale has been validated in Brazil
by Dodt in 2008, who applied it in a public hospital in Ceará.(7) This instrumentis clinically useful for
nurses to apply in the postpartum period, mainly
due to short hospital stays. The scale helps to recognize mothers who are likely to succeed in breastfeeding, providing them with positive reinforcement, as well as those who may need interventions
before discharge, in order to provide appropriate
and effective assistance.(8)
The scale consists of three dimensions (magnitude, generalization and strength) and is based on
four sources of information (personal experience,
observational or vicarious experience, verbal persuasion and emotional and physiological state).(9)
In each rated item, the woman gave a score ranging from 1 to 5 points (1 - Strongly disagree 2 Disagree, 3 - Sometimes agree, 4 - Agree and 5 Strongly agree).
For data collection, the women were interviewed once during hospitalization and after childbirth they were contacted by telephone on the 7th,
the 15th, the 30th, the 45th and the 60th day to monitor breastfeeding continuity.
For statistical analysis, the data were compiled
and analyzed using the SPSS (Statistical Package
for Social Sciences), version 16.0. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to evaluate the adhesion
of the dependent and independent continuous variables to the normal distribution curve. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated, and
ANOVA was employed to compare the duration of
breastfeeding among women with different degrees
of self-efficacy in breastfeeding. The chi-square test

was used for the association between problems in
each stage of BF monitoring. In all analyzes, the level of significance used was p ≥ 0.05.
The study development complied with all national and international ethical guidelines for research involving human subjects.

Results
The sociodemographic profile of the mothers who
participated in the study can be outlined as follows:
mean age of 32.8 years, ranging from 17 to 44
years; most of them (94.6%) are married, Catholics
(53.1%), have paid working activities (90%) and
completed higher education (70%). A total of 47%
were primipara, 43% secundipara, 87% of the deliveries were caesarean and 95.3% reported not having received any guidance on breastfeeding during
prenatal care.
The mean time of EBF was 53.2 days (SD 14.2),
ranging from 15 to 60 days (Table 1).

At the start of monitoring, in the seventh postpartum day, 100% of the women practiced EBF.
However, by the 15th day, 8% of mothers had
introduced a complement, therefore practicing
mixed feeding. On the 30th day, 15% of mothers supplemented breastfeeding with formula and
1% had weaned the baby. Exclusive breastfeeding
showed a progressive decline reaching 79% at 60
days (Table 2).

The score of the breastfeeding self-efficacy scale
varies from 14 to 70 points. When the respondent
obtains between 14 and 32 points, she is considered
to have Low efficacy; between 33 and 51, Moderate; and between 52 and 70, High efficacy.
Most mothers (82.3%) had scores compatible
with high self-efficacy for breastfeeding (52-70
points) and there was no mother with low efficacy
(Table 3).

The relationship between self-efficacy and the
duration of breastfeeding was assessed by measuring
the correlation of the scale scores (BSES-SF) and
the feeding time in days, as well as by comparing
the time of breastfeeding among women with moderate and high self-efficacy.
There was no statistically significant difference
in the comparison of mean time of exclusive and
non-exclusive breastfeeding, within moderate and
high efficacy scores.

Discussion
The limitations of the findings of this study are
related to the fact that the sample was originated
from only one service with specific characteristics,
and the monitoring of EBF was performed only up
to the 60th day after delivery.
In the sample studied, the findings did not enable to verify the self-efficacy scale as predictive for
early weaning. On the other hand, its clinical applicability was verified as a reliable instrument to assess
the perception of mothers about their breastfeeding self-efficacy, enabling professionals to identify
mothers who are susceptible to succeed in breastfeeding, as well as those who may need intervention
before hospital discharge.
The sociodemographic profile of the participants is consistent with the neighborhood where
they reside, economically differentiated. The percentage of cesarean sections (87%) is high, even
for an institution that primarily assists patients
using private health network, a result compatible
with a 2010 study which identified a 63.6% rate
of surgical births with an increasing trend, in these
services.(10)
The need for implementation of strategies that
enable women, assisted in the private network, to
have access to guidance on breastfeeding is evidenced by the high percentage of pregnant women
who received no information on the subject.
The mean duration of EBF was 53.2 days.
This result is consistent with that identified in
the last national survey of prevalence of breastfeeding in Brazilian state capitals and the Federal
District, held in 2008, which identified a median
EBF period of 54 days.
The expectation was to find longer periods of
EBF, since the mothers not only obtained moderate and high scores of breastfeeding self-efficacy,
but also belong to a more privileged social class and
presented high level of schooling, points considered
important to maintain EBF.
The monitoring of EBF began on the 7th day
after delivery and 100% of women were exclusively
breastfeeding their children. However, EBF showed
a progressive decline, reaching 79%, at 60 days.

Souza EF, Fernandes RA

A study that monitored EBF up to 180 days after
delivery revealed a higher number of abandonment after 60 days, and the percentage of mothers who exclusively breastfed up to the 60th day (70.4%) is slightly
lower than that found in the present study (79%).(11)
Rates of exclusive breastfeeding in Brazil are on
a rise, but still below what is recommended by the
WHO, which is 180 days. The percentage of 79%
of children being exclusively breastfed, identified
in this study, can be considered adequate, since the
WHO attributes this concept when 50% to 89%
of children under six months of age are exclusively
breastfed.(11) The application of the scale allowed to
identify that mothers presented high and moderate
efficacy and none of them obtained results consistent with low self-efficacy.
These results signaled that the mothers who
participated in this study would probably maintain
EBF for longer periods, a fact that was not consolidated at the end of monitoring.
A studythat used the same scale (Short Form)
in 294 postpartum women also noted the absence
of mothers with low efficacy. However, since the
mothers were not followed up, it was not possible
to compare the results.(7)
The comparison of the mean time of exclusive
and non-exclusive breastfeeding, with the scores of
moderate and high efficacy showed no statistically
significant difference, which indicates that, in this
study, the self-efficacy of the mothers did not influence the duration of breastfeeding.
Nevertheless, these results differ from those of
the original study, conducted in Canada, which
evaluated maternal confidence in breastfeeding
among 130 Canadians and found that the higher
the BSES score, the greater the likelihood of the
women maintaining exclusive breastfeeding at 6
weeks postpartum (p < 001).(12)
Another longitudinal studycarried out in Australia with 300 pregnant women evaluated the influence of changeable factors in prenatal and breastfeeding duration. The scale was applied in the last
trimester of pregnancy, at the 1st week postpartum
and at baby’s 4 months of life, and the results revealed that mothers who intended to breastfeed for
less than 6 months were 2.4 times more likely to

stop BF in 4 months than those who intended to
breastfeed for more than 12 months. Similarly, the
association of the BSES score with the duration of
exclusive breastfeeding showed that mothers with
higher self-efficacy scores were more likely to breastfeed longer, both one week and four months postpartum, than those presenting low self-efficacy in
feeding (p <0.05).(13)

Conclusion
The results did not confirm whether the scale may
be used as a predictor of risk of early weaning. In
addition, no relation between greater scores of high
efficacy and longer periods of exclusive breastfeeding was observed.
